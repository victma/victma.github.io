My personal website, showcasing most of my projects.

This website uses [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and is based on [gatsby-starter-portfolio-minimal](https://github.com/konstantinmuenster/gatsby-starter-portfolio-minimal). Shout-out to @konstantinmuenster for this very nice starter.

This is a work in progress. For now it is basically the starter with my content, but it does the job.
