  <h1>What is Serial Groover ?</h1>

    Serial Groover is a website (we're sure you got that already) that lets you play songs and videos one after another, automatically.

  <h1>Ok, but why would I want to use it ?</h1>

    Let's say you are at Bob's, streaming some nice music from his computer. Suddenly, you think about this other song, which is sooooo coool.
